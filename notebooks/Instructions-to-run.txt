There are two Jupiter notebooks in the current folder:
1. Data-Analysis.ipynb : Containing Exploratory Data Analysis and Data pre-processing
2. Model-Analysis.ipynb : Containing Comparision of Machine Learning Models

The Data-Analysis.ipynb takes the data from inventory "../data/creditcard.csv" which is of 96MB.
After pre-processing of data, the data will be saved as CSV file as "../data/updated_creditcard.csv" which is 106MB.
Since the maximum size of data can be uploaded to Github is 100MB, we cannot upload the final data required to run the "Model-Analysis.ipynb".
Thus, you need to run the "Data-Analysis.ipynb" first to create the updated dataset.
