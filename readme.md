# Prediction of Credit Card Fraud
Detect Fraudulent Credit Card transactions using different Machine Learning models and compare performances

In this notebook, I explore various Machine Learning models to detect fraudulent use of Credit cards. I compare each model's performance and results. Random Forest Classifier achieves the best performance.

## Problem Statement
In the era of prevalent online transactions, credit cards serve as a fundamental tool, offering unparalleled convenience and exposing users to fraud risk. This study aims to develop robust strategies and machine learning models to effectively recognize and prevent credit card fraud, addressing the challenge of imbalanced datasets. By enhancing fraud detection mechanisms, the research seeks to safeguard individuals and credit card companies from financial risks, ultimately contributing to digital payment systems' overall security and trust.

## Features
- Time: Time elapsed in seconds after the first transaction
- V1 to V28: PCA transformed features hidden due to confidentiality
- Amount: Amount of transaction
